time <- format(Sys.time(),"%d %b %Y")
```

- Author : J. Ivan Avalos
- date : `r time`

## Loading and preprocessing the data
* Check if the zip file has been unzipped
* Read activity.csv file
* Cast date variable to Date format 
```{r processingData, echo = TRUE, cache=TRUE}
if(!file.exists("activity.csv")){
    print("Unzipping the file")
    unzip(zipfile = "activity.zip")}

DFactivity <- read.csv("activity.csv",header = TRUE,na.strings = c("NA"))
DFactivity$date <- strptime(DFactivity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")   
head(DFactivity)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values
